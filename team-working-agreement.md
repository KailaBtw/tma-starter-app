# Team "Starburst" working Agreement

PHASE 1 STARBURST

aka "The St     artbursts"

## Communication
- How will we communicate? (Slack, Discord, email, etc.)
    Discord
- Response time expectations? (within 24 hours)
    Within a day
- When are we available? (time zones, schedules)
    Tuesday and Thursday after class are primary meeting times.
    We are also all available T/Th evening.
- UNCA Google Calendar: Can we assume they're up-to-date?
    Yep.
- How will we share updates? (daily? weekly? as needed?)
    We will have a standup at the start of Tuesday meeting, and a short standup after class on Thursday.

## Meetings
- How often will we meet? (weekly? as needed?)
    Weekly on Tuesday, can meet Thursday.
- How long? (1 hour? 2 hours?)
    1 hour Tuesday, can stay later for coworking
- Where? (in-person? Zoom? hybrid?)
    In-person
- What's the agenda? (standup? planning? coding together?)
    10 mins - standup
    20 mins - sprint planning
    30 mins+ - co-working

## Work Distribution
- How will we divide work? (volunteer? rotate? assign?)
        In sprint planning we will break out work into resonable tasks and then divide those tasks among the team. On Thursday we will be accountable to that work, through Standup Sessions.
- How will we ensure everyone contributes?
    Standup sessions = Accountability
- What if someone is struggling?
    Bloackers happen, standups are for sharing out what you are stuck on, the team will step in to help the person struggling. Co-working relieves a lot of blockers. 

## Code Review
- Who reviews PRs? (everyone? specific people?)
    When a PR is ready for review, post inside the team discord channel and ping team members to let them know you need peer review. In an ideal situation people with some knowledge on your changes will be able to peer review you, so it can also be helpful to ask a specific person to review.
- How quickly should reviews happen? (within 24 hours?)
    Within a couple days, ideally a PR posted on Tuesday, will be reviewed by Thursday. If not, bring it up to your team during standup.
- What makes a good review? (constructive, specific, kind)
    Constructive Feedback. 

## Conflict Resolution
- What if we disagree?
    Resolve among each other, if a mediator is needed then ask Dr. Sarah to intervene.
- What if someone isn't contributing?
    We will talk to them during standup and try to figure out their blockers and hold them accountable to their tasks.
- How do we give feedback?
    Mainly inside peer reviews, but also among team members in standup/planning meetings.

## Learning & Growth
- How will we help each other learn?
    Co-working sessions, pair programming, and informational shareout to relieve blockers.
- What if someone doesn't understand something?
    We will break into pairs when needed, pairing someone with knowledge to help them understand, good time for pair programming.
- How do we celebrate successes?
    At standups, and when merging code!
